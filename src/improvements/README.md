## Quick Start

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: **Do not** update `mise` to a newer version unless you're told to do so by the maintainers of this repository. We pin to specific allowed versions of `mise` to reduce the likelihood of installing a vulnerable version of `mise`. You **must** use the `install-mise.sh` script to install `mise`.

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd src/improvements/
./script/install-mise.sh # Follow the instructions in the log output from this command to activate mise in your shell.
mise trust ../../mise.toml
mise install
just --justfile ../../justfile install
```

> For more information on `mise`, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

2. Run tests:
Run all tests:
```bash
cd src/improvements/
just test # Run this command before asking for a review on any PR.
```

Run individual test suites:
```bash
forge test # Run solidity tests.
just simulate-all-templates # Run template regression tests.
```

3. Create a new task:
```bash
cd src/improvements/
just new task
```

Follow the interactive prompts from the `just new task` command to create a new task. This will create a new directory in the `tasks/` directory with the task name you provided. Please make sure to complete all the TODOs in the created files before submitting your task for review.

> Note: An `.env` file will be created in the new tasks directory. Please make sure to fill out the `TENDERLY_GAS` variable with a high enough value to simulate the task.

4. Configure the task in `config.toml` e.g.
```toml
l2chains = [{"name": "OP Mainnet", "chainId": 10}]
templateName = "<TEMPLATE_NAME>" # e.g. OPCMUpgradeV200

# Add template-specific config here.

[addresses]
# Addresses that are not discovered automatically (e.g. OPCM, StandardValidator, or safes missing from addresses.toml).
# IMPORTANT: If an address is defined here and also discovered onchain, this value takes precedence (e.g. ProxyAdminOwner).

[stateOverrides]
# State overrides (e.g. specify a Safe nonce).
```

The `[addresses]` TOML [table](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#table) is optional. It can be used to specify the addresses of the contracts involved in an upgrade. You can see an example of its use in this [task](./tasks/eth/009-opcm-update-prestate-v300-op+ink/config.toml).

The `[stateOverrides]` TOML table is optional, but in most cases we use it to specify the nonces of the multisig safes involved in an upgrade. Selecting the correct nonce is important and requires careful consideration. You can see an example of its use in this [task](./tasks/eth/009-opcm-update-prestate-v300-op+ink/config.toml). If you're unsure about the format of the `key` and `value` fields, you must default to using 66-character hex strings (i.e. `0x` followed by 64 hex characters). For example, setting the nonce for a Safe to `23` would look like:

```toml
# USE HEX ENCODED STRINGS WHEN POSSIBLE.
[stateOverrides]
0x847B5c174615B1B7fDF770882256e2D3E95b9D92 = [ 
    { key = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005", value = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000017" }
]
```

However, in some cases it's possible to use the decimal value directly:
```toml
# IN SOME CASES, YOU CAN USE THE DECIMAL VALUE DIRECTLY.
[stateOverrides]
0x847B5c174615B1B7fDF770882256e2D3E95b9D92 = [ 
    { key = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005", value = 23 }
]
```

But **do not** pass the decimal value as a string‚Äîthis will cause undefined behavior:
```toml
# ‚ùå INCORRECT: DO NOT USE STRINGIFIED DECIMALS.
[stateOverrides]
0x847B5c174615B1B7fDF770882256e2D3E95b9D92 = [ 
    { key = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005", value = "23" }
]
```

5. Simulate the task:
```bash
# Nested
SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER=1 just --dotenv-path $(pwd)/.env --justfile ../../../nested.just simulate <foundation|council|chain-governor|foundation-operations|base-operations|[custom-safe-name]>
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è [custom-safe-name] refers to a Safe name defined manually by the task developer under the `[addresses]` table in the config.toml file.
> Example: NestedSafe1 in [sep/001-opcm-upgrade-v200/config.toml](./tasks/sep/001-opcm-upgrade-v200/config.toml).

```bash
# Single 
SIMULATE_WITHOUT_LEDGER=1 just --dotenv-path $(pwd)/.env --justfile ../../../single.just simulate
```

6. Fill out the `README.md` and `VALIDATION.md` files.
    - If your task status is not `EXECUTED` or `CANCELLED`, it is considered non-terminal and will automatically be included in stacked simulations (which run on the main branch).

### How do I run a task that depends on another task?

> Note:
> Tasks get executed in the order they are defined in the `tasks/<network>/` directory. We use 3 digit prefixes to order the tasks e.g. `001-` is executed before `002-`, etc.

Stacked simulations are supported. To use this feature, you can use the following command:
```bash
just simulate-stack <network> [task] [owner-address]
```

e.g. 
```bash
# Simulate all tasks up to and including the latest non-terminal task.
just simulate-stack eth
# OR to simulate up to and including a specific task. Useful if you don't care about simulating tasks after a certain point.
just simulate-stack eth 002-opcm-upgrade-v200
# OR to simulate up to and including a specific task, and specify the owner address to simulate as (useful for getting the correct domain and message hash).
just simulate-stack eth 002-opcm-upgrade-v200 0x847B5c174615B1B7fDF770882256e2D3E95b9D92
```

Another useful command is to list the tasks that will be simulated in a stacked simulation:
```bash
just list-stack <network> [task]
```

e.g.
```bash
just list-stack eth
# OR if you want to list the tasks up to and including a specific task.
just list-stack eth <your-task-name>
```

## Available Templates

All available templates can be found in the [template](./template/) directory.
