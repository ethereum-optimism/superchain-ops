/// @notice Template contract to transfer ownership of the L2 ProxyAdmin to the aliased L1 ProxyAdmin owner.

/// 1. Find the L2 deposit transaction by identifying the alias of the L1 ProxyAdmin owner safe.
/// 2. The transaction you're looking for should be the most recent transaction sent from the aliased

///    with the L1 ProxyAdmin 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000018.
/// 3. Once you've found the correct transaction, verify that the expected log event was emitted i.e. 'emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner)'.
