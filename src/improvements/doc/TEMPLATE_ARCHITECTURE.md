# Template Architecture Guide

This guide explains the architecture of the template system, including configuration structure, file organization, and validation requirements.

## Template Configuration Structure

### 1. Template Location

Templates are Solidity contracts located in the `src/improvements/template/` directory. Each template is designed for a specific type of task operation.

### 2. Configuration File Architecture

Each task requires a `config.toml` file with two main components:

1. L2 Chain Configuration
2. Template Selection

#### L2 Chain Configuration

Every config file must specify the L2 chains that the task will interact with:

```toml
l2chains = [
    {name = "Orderly", chainId = 291},
    {name = "Metal", chainId = 1750}
]
```

All L2 Chains specified in a task config file must be part of the same superchain instance, i.e. have the same Gnosis Safe as their Proxy Admin Owner.

#### Template Selection

Templates are specified using the `templateName` parameter:

```toml
templateName = "GasConfigTemplate"  # Uses src/improvements/template/GasConfigTemplate.sol
```

### 3. Task Status Definitions

Tasks can have the following statuses in their README files:

- `DRAFT, NOT READY TO SIGN`: Initial development stage, not ready to sign
- `CONTINGENCY TASK, SIGN AS NEEDED`: Task that may be signed based on specific conditions, such as emergency rollback.
- `READY TO SIGN`: Task ready for signature
- `SIGNED`: Task signed and ready for execution
- `EXECUTED`: Task completed successfully. Once executed, this field should include a link to the transaction hash.
- `CANCELLED`: Execution failed or abandoned

### 4. Template-Specific Configuration

Each template type has its own configuration structure. For example:

```toml
# Gas Config Template
[gasConfigs]
gasLimits = [
    {chainId = 291, gasLimit = 100000000},
    {chainId = 1750, gasLimit = 100000000}
]

# Dispute Game Template
implementations = [{
    gameType = 0,
    implementation = "0xf691F8A6d908B58C534B624cF16495b491E633BA",
    l2ChainId = 10
}]
```

## Validation System

The template system includes built-in validation:

1. Configuration Validation
   - Verifies TOML syntax
   - Checks required fields
   - Validates chain IDs
   - Ensures parameter types match expectations

2. State Change Validation
   - Verifies changes match expected values

3. Security Checks
   - Verifies permissions
   - Validates address formats
   - Checks value ranges
   - Check that only the expected storage slots are modified
