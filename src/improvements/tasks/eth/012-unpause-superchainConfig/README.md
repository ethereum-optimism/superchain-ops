# 012 - Unpause the SuperchainConfig

Status: [EXECUTED](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x758b4196114928b4e43c2f3b6d65e0737dde9f1ed6f346eac16843f5fd3fac74)

## Objective

This task will unpause mainnet `SuperchainConfig` following the pause of the Superchain. This will occurs, since we are testing that U13 upgrade and the most particulary if the Pause Mechanism is working as expected.
This task **UnPause** the SuperchainConfig contract. This will first check if the Superchain is `paused`.
Worth noting that, if this is not `paused` this task will **do nothing** and revert earlier to not consume a nonce of the FoS.
If the `SuperchainConfig` is `paused` this will unpause the `SuperchainConfig` contract.
This task, is a single task and has to be signed by the **FoundationOperationsSafe**.
