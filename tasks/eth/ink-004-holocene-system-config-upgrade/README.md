Status: DRAFT, NOT READY TO SIGN

## Objective

Upgrades the `SystemConfig` for the Holocene hardfork.

The proposal was:

- [x] [Posted](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-11-holocene-network-upgrade/9313) on the governance forum.
- [x] [Approved](https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/20127877429053636874064552098716749508236019236440427814457915785398876262515) by Token House voting.
- [x] Not vetoed by the Citizens' house.
- [x] Executed on OP Mainnet.

This upgrades the SystemConfig in the v1.8.0-rc.4 release.

The governance proposal should be treated as the source of truth and used to verify the correctness of the onchain operations.

This upgrades the `SystemConfig` in the
[v1.8.0-rc.4](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/v1.8.0-rc.4) release.

## Pre-deployments

- `SystemConfig` - `0xAB9d6cB7A427c0765163A7f45BB91cAfe5f2D375`

## Simulation

Please see the "Simulating and Verifying the Transaction" instructions in [NESTED.md](../../../NESTED.md).
When simulating, ensure the logs say `Using script /your/path/to/superchain-ops/tasks/<path>/NestedSignFromJson.s.sol`.
This ensures all safety checks are run. If the default `NestedSignFromJson.s.sol` script is shown (without the full path), something is wrong and the safety checks will not run.

## State Validation

Please see the instructions for [validation](./VALIDATION.md).

## Execution

This upgrade
* Changes the implementation of the `SystemConfig` to hold EIP-1559 parameters for the Holocene upgrade.

The batch will be executed on chain ID `1`, and contains `3` transactions.

## Tx #1: ProxyAdmin.upgrade(SystemConfigProxy, StorageSetter)
Upgrades the `SystemConfigProxy`to the StorageSetter.

**Function Signature:** `upgrade(address,address)`

## Tx #2: SystemConfigProxy.setBytes32(0,0)
Zeroes out the initialized state variable to allow reinitialization.

**Function Signature:** `setBytes32(bytes32,bytes32)`

## Tx #3: ProxyAdmin.upgradeAndCall(SystemConfigProxy, SystemConfigImplementation, Initialize())
Upgrades the SystemConfig to a new implementation and initializes it.

**Function Signature:** `upgradeAndCall(address,address,bytes)`
