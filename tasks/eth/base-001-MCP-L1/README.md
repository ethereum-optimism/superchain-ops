The governance proposal should be treated as the source of truth and used to verify the correctness
of the onchain operations.

## Simulation

Please see the "Simulating and Verifying the Transaction" instructions in [NESTED.md](../../../NESTED.md).
When simulating, ensure the logs say `Using script Using script /your/path/to/superchain-ops/tasks/eth/base-001-MCP-L1/NestedSignFromJson.s.sol`.
Thus ensures all safety checks are run. If the default `NestedSignFromJson.s.sol` script is shown
(without the full path), something is wrong and the safety checks will not run.

When signing as a Base signer, use `council` as the argument to the just command. 
This is actually the Base safe but the `nested.just` file uses council as a keyword and
we want to minimize changes.

Do NOT yet proceed to the "Execute the Transaction" section.

## State Validations

Please see the instructions for [validation](./VALIDATION.md).

## Execution

At this point you may resume following the execution instructions in the "Execute the Transaction" section of [NESTED.md](../../../NESTED.md).

When executing, ensure the logs say `Using script Using script /your/path/to/superchain-ops/tasks/eth/base-001-MCP-L1/NestedSignFromJson.s.sol`.
Thus ensures all safety checks are run. If the default `NestedSignFromJson.s.sol` script is shown
(without the full path), something is wrong and the safety checks will not run.
