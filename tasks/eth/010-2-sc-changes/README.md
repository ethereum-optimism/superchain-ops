# Security Council Safe Changes

Status: READY TO SIGN

## Objective

This is the playbook for changes to be made to the Security Council's configuration.

There are two Safes controlled by the Security Council:

1. The Security Council Safe at `0xc2819DC788505Aac350142A7A707BF9D03E3Bd03`.
2. The 1/1 Guardian Safe owned by the Security Council at `0x09f7150D8c019BeF34450d6920f6B3608ceFdAf2`.

The following state changes will be made to those Safes:

1. On the Security Council safe, increase the threshold to at least 75% (from 4/13 to 10/13).
2. On the Security Council safe, set the `LivenessGuard` at `0x24424336F04440b1c28685a38303aC33C9D14a25`.
3. On the Security Council safe, enable the `LivenessModule` at `0x0454092516c9A4d636d3CAfA1e82161376C8a748`.
4. On the 1/1 Guardian Safe, enable the `DeputyGuardianModule` at `0x5dC91D01290af474CE21DE14c17335a6dEe4d2a8`.

These modules are documented in the OP Stack Specification's [Security Council Safe document](https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/security-council-safe.html).

These changes are required to meet the [requirements for a Stage 1 rollup](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52).

## Simulation

Please see the "Simulating and Verifying the Transaction" instructions in [SINGLE.md](../../../SINGLE.md).

When simulating, ensure the logs say `Using script /your/path/to/superchain-ops/tasks/eth/010-2-sc-changes/SignFromJson.s.sol`. This ensures all safety checks are run. If the default `SignFromJson.s.sol` script is shown (without the full path), something is wrong and the safety checks will not run.

Do NOT yet proceed to the "Execute the Transaction" section.

## State Validations

Please see the instructions for [validation](./VALIDATION.md).

## Execution

At this point you may resume following the execution instructions in the "Execute the Transaction" section of [SINGLE.md](../../../SINGLE.md).

When executing, ensure the logs say `Using script /your/path/to/superchain-ops/tasks/eth/010-2-sc-changes/SignFromJson.s.sol`. This ensures all safety checks are run. If the default `SignFromJson.s.sol` script is shown (without the full path), something is wrong and the safety checks will not run.
