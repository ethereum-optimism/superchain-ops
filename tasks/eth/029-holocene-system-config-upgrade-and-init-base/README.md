# Holocene Hardfork Upgrade - `SystemConfig`

Status: [EXECUTED](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x765a2eb3c7eecea5722b120037123eaec9e6ef4b6a53ba2bcfb88ef08fae074b)

## Objective

Upgrades the `SystemConfig` for the Holocene hardfork and sets the EIP1559 parameters

- This upgrades the `SystemConfig` in the
[v1.8.0-rc.4](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/v1.8.0-rc.4) release.

- Unrelated to the Holocene upgrade itself, two additional transactions (tx 4 and 5) are included for convenience:
    - Tx 4 sets the EIP-1559 parameters to `_denominator = 250` (unchanged) and `_elasticity = 2`. With a new `_gasLimit = 96M`, this _elasticity value results in a target gas of `24M`. Additionally, the `blobbasefeeScalar` is set to `1055762` and the `basefeeScalar` is set to `2269`.

    - Tx 5 restores the SystemConfig's owner address to its original value (`0x14536667Cd30e52C0b458BaACcB9faDA7046E056`). This is needed because the SystemConfig's owner was temporarily set to the ProxyAdmin's owner address (`0x7bB41C3008B3f03FE483B28b8DB90e19Cf07595c`) in tx 3 so that we could batch tx 4 (which has an `onlyOwner` modifier) in the same muticall transaction.

## Pre-deployments

- `SystemConfig` - `0xAB9d6cB7A427c0765163A7f45BB91cAfe5f2D375`

## Simulation

Please see the "Simulating and Verifying the Transaction" instructions in [NESTED.md](../../../NESTED.md).
When simulating, ensure the logs say `Using script /your/path/to/superchain-ops/tasks/eth/029-holocene-system-config-upgrade-and-init-base/NestedSignFromJson.s.sol`.
This ensures all safety checks are run. If the default `NestedSignFromJson.s.sol` script is shown (without the full path), something is wrong and the safety checks will not run.

## State Validation

Please see the instructions for [validation](./VALIDATION.md).

## Execution

This upgrade
* Changes the implementation of the `SystemConfig` to hold EIP-1559 parameters.
* Initializes the EIP-1559 parameters to `_denominator = 250` and `_elasticity = 2`.
* Sets the `gasLimit` to `96M`.

See the `input.json` bundle for more details.
