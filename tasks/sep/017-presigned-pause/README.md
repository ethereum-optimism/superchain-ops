# Superchain Presigned Pause

Status: READY TO SIGN

See [../../../PRESIGNED-PAUSE.md](../../../PRESIGNED-PAUSE.md) for the playbook.

## Objective

The Deputy Guardian Module was updated which broke the [previous pre-signed pauses](../011-presigned-pause/). 

This generates new presigned pauses for Sepolia based on the architecture introduced in [tasks/sep/006-1-guardian-upgrade](../006-1-guardian-upgrade/README.md) and [tasks/sep/006-2-sc-changes](../006-2-sc-changes/README.md).

The Deputy Guardian Module address changed from: `0x4220C5deD9dC2C8a8366e684B098094790C72d3c` to: `0xfd7E6Ef1f6c9e4cC34F54065Bf8496cE41A4e2e8`
