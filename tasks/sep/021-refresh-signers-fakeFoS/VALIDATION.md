# Validation

This document can be used to validate the state diff resulting from the execution of the transaction.

For each contract listed in the state diff, please verify that no contracts or state changes shown in the Tenderly diff are missing from this document. Additionally, please verify that for each contract:

- The following state changes (and none others) are made to that contract. This validates that no unexpected state changes occur.
- All addresses (in section headers and storage values) match the provided name, using the Etherscan and Superchain Registry links provided. This validates the bytecode deployed at the addresses contains the correct logic.
- All key values match the semantic meaning provided, which can be validated using the storage layout links provided.

## Owners

The changes of the owners should be as follows below.
This require multiples storage changes because the owners list is represented by a linked list.

- Key: 0x00e6aef00fdbd2b42a717bf8a7596fb523db8d5582c30496b08056c941430612

  Meaning: Make the `SENTINEL_ADDRESS` point to the address `0xa03dafade71f1544f4b0120145eec9b89105951f` to be part of the linked list.

To precompute the storage location we need to use the `cast index`:

```shell
cast index address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 2
0xe90b7bceb6e7df5418fb78d8ee546e97c83a08bbccc01a0644d599ccd2a7c2e0 // this is the storage of the SENTINEL_ADDRESS pointing to.
```

The address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001` is the `SENTINEL_ADDRESS` and the `2` is the slot of the mapping (address => address).

We can reproduce the same process for the other addresses.
