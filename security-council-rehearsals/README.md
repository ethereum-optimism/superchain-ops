## Creating and signing a new rehearsal ceremony

To create a new rehearsal ceremony, follow the instructions in the _Facilitator_ section of the README files for each of the following rehearsals:
1. [rehearsal-1-welcome](./rehearsal-1-welcome/README.md)
2. [rehearsal-2-remove-signer](./rehearsal-2-remove-signer/README.md)
3. [rehearsal-3-nested-upgrade](./rehearsal-3-jointly-upgrade/README.md)

If you're a signer, you can find instructions for signing the rehearsals in the top sections of the same README files.
